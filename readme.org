* Dylos1100-Pro Automation

python code for processing dylos1100-pro output.

presumes owning a dylos1100-pro, linux, python3, bash, as well as a serial-usb cable

0. connect the cord to your machine, hopefully it autodetects it.

1. `pip install pyserial` for reading the port

2. adjust dylos.sh to write to your own data store. Or, hey, ping me
   if you want to experiment with my data ingest system.

3. run dylos.sh, watch the data flow.



* hacking notes:

configure the serial line at 9600,8n1

The format is `>pm05, >pm25<cr><lf>` every minute. Not complicated.

dylos.py reads the serial and outputs it as json.
